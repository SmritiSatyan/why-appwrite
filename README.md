# why-appwrite

Appwrite is an open-source, developer-first backend that prioritizes clarity, usability, and real-world developer experience. 

Appwrite removes unnecessary complexity around auth, databases, storage, and APIs, letting developers focus on building products instead of worrying about the infrastructure. It focuses on simplicity, transparency, and strong community-driven development.
